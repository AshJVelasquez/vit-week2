# HTML

Bob is hiring you to build his website and out of excitement, he bought the domain before you completed his portfolio. Let's put a temporary landing page!

## Start Here

You're **only** going to work inside of the index.html page for this exercise.

Look around the css file to gain some familiarity.

This is the CSS-first approach.

### The objective

- A main background for the whole page. The image has been set, so you just need add the most parent element within the body tag, an id: `background` and class: `center`.
- Add an input tag underneath the h2 with an id: `input`
- Add a button with the text "Submit" after the input tag

Don't forget to commit! The message will be `[Name] has completed Part 2.`

Next, head over to the disney movie branch
